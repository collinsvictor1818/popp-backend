# AWS ECS and Fargate Deployment

This document provides guidance on deploying and managing the Popp AI system using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate. AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. Fargate makes it easy to focus on building your applications without needing to provision or manage servers.

## Container Images

The Popp AI system is deployed as Docker containers.

*   **Docker Images:** The application's Docker images should be built and pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
*   **ECR Repositories:** A dedicated ECR repository should be created for the Popp AI system's images.
*   **Tagging Conventions:** Implement a consistent tagging strategy for your Docker images (e.g., `latest`, `git-commit-sha`, `version-x.y.z`) to facilitate deployments and rollbacks.

## Task Definitions

An ECS Task Definition is a blueprint for your application. It describes one or more containers that form your application, including:

*   **Container Configurations:** Docker image, CPU and memory limits, port mappings, environment variables, logging configuration, and health checks.
*   **CPU and Memory:** Specify the CPU and memory allocated to the task. For Fargate, these are defined at the task level.
*   **IAM Roles:** Define task execution roles and task roles for permissions needed by the containers.

## Services and Clusters

*   **ECS Cluster:** A logical grouping of tasks or services. For Fargate, you don't manage the underlying EC2 instances.
*   **ECS Service:** Maintains the desired count of tasks, runs and maintains your desired number of copies of a task definition, and can automatically scale based on demand.
*   **Desired Count:** Configure the number of tasks you want to run for your application.
*   **Auto Scaling:** Implement service auto-scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization or request count to handle varying loads.

## Networking

Proper networking configuration is crucial for ECS Fargate deployments.

*   **VPC:** Deploy your ECS cluster and services within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
*   **Subnets:** Use private subnets for your Fargate tasks and public subnets for load balancers.
*   **Security Groups:** Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for your tasks and load balancers.
*   **Load Balancer:** Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic across your Fargate tasks, providing high availability and scalability.

## CI/CD Integration

Integrating ECS Fargate with a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the deployment process.

*   **Build Stage:** Build Docker images and push them to ECR.
*   **Deployment Stage:** Update the ECS service with the new task definition revision pointing to the latest Docker image.
*   **Tools:** AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be used to automate these steps.
